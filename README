tmux: X edition, under development

This is a fork of tmux that has a built-in X-terminal (ala xterm, rxvt, etc.).
See NOTES for more information on tmux itself.  Aside from the new features,
xtmux is binary-compatible with tmux (i.e., a tmux client can talk to an xtmux
server just fine), and building with --disbable-xtmux should result in an
exact, original tmux.

The motivation for this is efficiency: normally when you run tmux (or screen)
in an xterm, all the terminal control commands from programs are interpreted by
tmux, kept in a screen buffer, translated and sent to the xterm, interpreted by
the xterm, buffered again and rendered.  With xtmux, we can eliminate more that
half of that processing and memory usage.  Additionally, a single tmux server
will be able to manage multiple terminal windows, further saving memory.

Usage: 
  configure --enable-xtmux
  tmux -x

xtmux is still under heavy development and has only limited functionality.
