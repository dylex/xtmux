When reporting issues:

YOU MUST INCLUDE THE TMUX VERSION

DO NOT OPEN AN ISSUE THAT DOES NOT MENTION THE TMUX VERSION

Please also include:

- your platform (Linux, OS X, or whatever);
- a brief description of the problem with steps to reproduce;
- a minimal tmux config, if you can't reproduce without a config;
- your terminal, and $TERM inside and outside of tmux;
- logs from tmux (see below);
- at most one or two screenshots, if helpful.

This should include at least the output of:

    $ uname -sp && tmux -V && echo $TERM

Please do not report bugs (crashes, incorrect behaviour) without reproducing on
a tmux built from Git master.

Note that TERM inside tmux must be a variant of screen or tmux (for example:
screen or screen-256color, tmux or tmux-256color). Please ensure this is the
case before opening an issue.

To run tmux without a config and get logs, run:

    tmux -Ltest kill-server
    tmux -vvvv -Ltest -f/dev/null new

Then reproduce the problem, exit tmux, and attach the tmux-server-*.log file
from the current directory to the issue.
